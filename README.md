# imageClassifier for the MNIST Fashion Dataset
Classifies images of clothes using Random Forest Algorithm with 88% accuracy. 

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a dataset of images of clothes. It stores the images in the form of an array of pixels which is inputted inside our Random Forest Classifier for training. After training the model, we can test it by inputting a new image of a clothing item in the form of a numpy array of pixels and it will output a class (of clothing) with 88% accuracy

The Fashion MNIST database isn't a part of the code in the repository but it can be easily found at Kaggle at the following link
